## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### **System Architecture & User Flow**

The system is designed with a clear, intuitive workflow that guides users through every inventory management task. Here's how it works in practice:

---

### **1. User Authentication & Branch Selection**

**The Process:**
1. User logs in with their credentials (email/password)
2. System authenticates and loads user's assigned branches
3. User selects their working branch from the list
4. System remembers the last selected branch for future logins
5. User is redirected to the dashboard for their selected branch

**Example Scenario:**
> Sarah, a branch manager at Munyonyo, logs in. She sees her assigned branches (Munyonyo, Nakawa). She selects "Munyonyo" and immediately sees only Munyonyo's stock, assignments, and data. No Nakawa items appear in her view.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Branch context is maintained throughout the session
- ✅ Users can switch branches (requires re-authentication for security)
- ✅ System admins see all branches; regular users see only assigned branches
- ✅ Branch selection persists across sessions

---

### **2. Stock Upload & Management**

**The Process:**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Excel File**
- Staff prepares an Excel file with stock data (product name, quantity, price, expiry date)
- File can be in any format - the system handles custom column mapping

#### **Step 2: Select Import Template (Optional)**
- System offers import templates for consistent data format
- Templates can be branch-specific or shared across branches
- If no template selected, system uses standard column names

#### **Step 3: Upload & Validate**
- User uploads Excel file through the web interface
- System automatically validates:
  - Product names are not empty
  - Quantities are positive numbers
  - Prices are valid decimal values
  - Expiry dates are in the future (with warnings for near-expiry)
- System detects duplicates (same product, same expiry date)
- System checks for data quality issues

#### **Step 4: Preview & Confirm**
- User reviews the validated data in a preview table
- System shows:
  - Number of valid items
  - Number of invalid items (with reasons)
  - Duplicate items detected
  - Branch assignment (automatically set to selected branch)
- User confirms or cancels the upload

#### **Step 5: Process Upload**
- System processes valid items
- Shows real-time progress bar
- Creates stock items in the database
- Records movement history for audit trail
- Sends completion notification

**Example Scenario:**
> John, an inventory assistant at Nakawa branch, uploads a new shipment of 150 items. The system validates the data, identifies 3 duplicates, flags 2 items with expired dates, and successfully uploads 145 valid items. All items are automatically assigned to Nakawa branch, and John receives a summary showing exactly what was uploaded.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automatic branch assignment (no need to specify branch in Excel)
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevents data errors
- ✅ Validation catches issues before upload
- ✅ Progress tracking shows upload status
- ✅ Complete audit trail of all uploads

- Check for any issues or alerts
- Plan for next day's priorities

**Example Scenario:**
> Every morning, Maria (Branch Manager at Munyonyo) checks her dashboard. She sees 5 items expiring in the next 7 days with a total value of $5,000. She immediately assigns these items to dispensers for urgent distribution. The system automatically sends WhatsApp notifications to assigned dispensers, and Maria can track the assignment status in real-time.
